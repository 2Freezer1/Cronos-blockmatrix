# Cronos-blockmatrix
A simulation framework for resonance-based reality selection

# CRONOS–Blockmatrix Simulation

This project explores how reality stabilizes through resonance.  
It models the selection of stable paths using real-world data (GitHub PRs) and simulates resonance dynamics using Python.

## Core Concepts
- **Resonance Density (ρ)**: A measure of system stability
- **Mismatch Penalty (E = k·Δρ²)**: Energy cost for deviating from stable paths
- **CRONOS Operator**: A selector that amplifies coherent states

## What This Code Does
- Classifies real-world events into STABLE, DIVERGENT, NEUTRAL
- Builds time series of resonance metrics (τ_T, γ, T7)
- Forecasts system stability using SARIMA
- Tests predictive power with Granger causality

## Results
Plots and forecasts included for:
- Bitcoin/Bitcoin
- Microsoft/VSCode
- Meta-analysis across 11,000+ PRs

## Why It Matters
This is a prototype for understanding reality as a resonance field — bridging consciousness, quantum mechanics, and classical systems.

## Author
Adrian — visionary systems thinker exploring the architecture behind reality.
