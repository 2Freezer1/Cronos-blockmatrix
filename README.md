CRONOS-Blockmatrix Theory (C-BMT)
​A Non-Linear Topological Framework for State Selection in Complex Systems
​Abstract
​The CRONOS-Blockmatrix Theory (C-BMT) proposes a unified physical mechanism for the emergence of stable reality from a Hilbert space of potentials (\mathcal{M}, the Blockmatrix). It posits that "Wave Function Collapse" is not a probabilistic event, but an energetic selection process governed by the Minimum Cost Principle.
​This repository contains the theoretical derivations and early cognitive simulations supporting the hypothesis that complex systems (biological, social, and quantum) self-organize to minimize the energetic cost of information coherence.
​The Governing Equation
​The stability of any selected reality branch is defined by the Deterministic Energy Cost (E_{Det}):
E_{Det} = k (\Delta\rho)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta S}{N_{effective}} + \delta_Q

​\Delta\rho (Resonance Gradient): The energetic penalty for deviating from the established laws of the local cluster.
​N_{effective} (Consensus): The density of observers or interacting agents. Higher N lowers the selection cost.
​\delta_Q (Quantum Flux): The stochastic background noise (entropy) that acts as the "temperature" of the selection field.
​Experimental Validation
​The principles derived in this theoretical framework are currently being tested in high-frequency financial markets (as a proxy for high-consensus quantum fields).
​See the Experimental Apparatus: FDM-Resonance-Detector
​Status: The FDM v9.4 algorithm has successfully detected "Resonance Inertia" and "Entropy Decay" boundaries in live market data, validating the N \propto Stability relationship.
​Sub-Modules
​Cognitive Decay Model (CDM): Applies C-BMT to human information retrieval (Wikipedia Search Logs) to measure "Cognitive Collapse" thresholds.
​Qubit Resonance: Prototyping the "Free Will Selection Rule" in simulated entangled qubit systems.
